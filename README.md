The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides state-of-the art genome editing capabilities. However, the choice of guide RNA heavily restricts its ability to be practically applied. A good gRNA maximizes on-target activity while minimizing potential off-target effects, making it critical for successful gene editing. Consequently, picking a well-suited gRNA is critically important in using CRISPR, however, determining one can eat up resources and time.
The deep-learning pipelines above aim to stramline this process by providing a probability between 0 and 1 of a gRNA cutting at its intended target. The parameters needed are: 30 nucleotide long gRNA sequence(which includes 4 nucleotides upstream and 3 nucleotides downstream of the PAM sequence, and the 23 nucleotide protospacer sequence with a canonical PAM sequence (NGG)), the percent peptide, the amino acid cut position, and the gene drug rank score.
The above models, crispr-keras and crispr-rnn, differ slightly. The crispr-rnn model uses RNN layers in conjunction with CNN layers while the crispr-keras model only uses CNN layers for its semantic encoding. It is reccomended to use crispr-rnn as it has proved to be more reliable.
